        What does a person's birthday signifies? Does it signifies the aging
        effect of human? Does it signifies the passage of time and that you have
        less time left? Or does it signifies the 1 extra year of experience of
        have now to face challenges? The answer depends on the way you perceive
        your life.
        <br />
        A river's goal is to reach the sea. It has to travel tremendous
        distance, and has to face all kids of huge rocks. But it never stops
        flowing. Similarly, I have faith that even you won't stop chasing your
        dreams (your purpose of life) until you achieve it.
        <br />
        You have always been a motivation to me. I have admired you for how hard
        working and ambitious you are. I will always look up to you whenever I
        might need motivation myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        While browsing the internet, I came across a quote (always remember this
        when you feel down)-
        <br />
        <span className="purple">
          “We need accept that we might not always succeed. Understanding that
          failure is not the opposite of success, it’s the part of success.”
        </span>
        <br />
        In a similar way, hard work is also a part of success.
        <br />
        <br />
        Lastly, never forget that I will always be your biggest fan, your
        biggest supporter. I wish for your good health and success this 
        year and every coming years of your life.
        <br />
        <br />
        Your fan,
        <br />
        Gautam
        <br />
